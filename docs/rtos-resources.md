[Why and how to measure your RTOS performance](http://www.embedded.com/design/operating-systems/4437792/Why-and-how-to-measure-your-RTOS-performance)

RTOS Metrics. There are three areas of interest if you are looking at the performance and usage characteristics of an RTOS:

- `Memory` â€“ how much ROM and RAM does the kernel need and how is this affected by options and configuration.
- `Latency`, which is broadly the delay between something happening and the response to that occurrence. This is a particular minefield of terminology and misinformation, but there are two essential latencies to consider: interrupt response and task scheduling.
- `Performance of kernel services`. How long does it take to perform specific actions?
